# shoebot-play

Some experiments with the wonderful **`shoebot`**, the *easy vector graphics with Python* library & environment.

> **Shoebot** is a creative coding environment designed for making vector graphics and animations with Python. It's a versatile tool aimed at a number of purposes:
> - an extensive set of drawing commands for playful graphic exploration
> - make SVG images for pen plotters, or output to PDF and PNG
> - create simple animations and save them to MP4 files
> - generate image sets headlessly from a script

### Tips for going from Processing to shoebot

Here are some things that I noticed are different for people coming from [Processing Python mode](https://abav.lugaralgum.com/como-instalar-o-processing-modo-python/index-EN.html).

Text, typography features are awesome. I have to write something about them.

#### setup & draw differences

My first conceptual "mismatch" surprise was finding out that each frame generated by the looping `draw()` user defined function will *automaticaly clean the frame*. This is not so in Processing, if you don't actively clear the frame with `background()` things "accumulate". I suppose this might have to do with the more vector-based approach by shoebot, so I would guess Processing, even if it can work with vector graphics, is more raster-focused out of the box and then it all makse a bit more sense. I have to investigate if there is a setting/toggle somewhere that can change this.

So if you want to interactively accumulate stuff, plan ahead and collect information in a data structure so you can re-draw at each frame whatever was there before.

#### color

On **shoebot** color arguments are from `0` to `1` and not `0` to `255`, unless yous use `colorrange(255)` or `colormode(RGBA, range=255)`.

#### rect & ellipse modes

When you draw ellipses and circles `ellipsemode(CORNER)` is the default in shoebot (use `CENTER` for the default Processing behavior).

#### coordinates and tranformations

There are no `tranform()` modes in Processing, and shoebot default mode is `transform(CENTER)` that can be very useful (makes elements rotate around themselves). You can get a Processing-like behavior with `transform(CORNER)`.

The `rotate()` function arguments are in degrees by default, but you can use keyword arguments like this: `rotate(radians=angle_in_radians)`.

### maths and angles

```python
from math import pi, sin, cos
```

### Breaking 'style state' with custom attributes in optional arguments and more

*Note that in Processing `rect()` returns `None` and not an object you could transform! But in **shoebot** you can do this:*

`rect(20, 20, 100, 100, fill=(1, 0, 0))`

*which is the same as*

```python
r = rect(20, 20, 100, 100)
r.fill = color(1, 0, 0)
# This instantly draws a red rectangle regardless of the
# current state fill color. Likewise you could also use:
r.translate(x, y=None)
r.rotate(degrees=0, radians=0)
r.scale(x, y=None)
r.skew(x, y=None)
# The transformations are then applied only to rectangle r.
```

With the `text()` command you can also use the state-less *font* and *fontsize* parameters:

`text("hello", 20, 20, font="Helvetica")`
